Transfer Learning for EEG Subject Classification

This repo contains PyTorch code for my project on Transfer Learning for EEG Data.

To add more models, clone and add to model.py and import the model in the run notebook.
analysis_runs.ipnyb was used for analyzing hyperparameter importance in the metrics obtained after running.
